Real-Time Access:

Users should be able to see their updated portfolio at any time.
Live Price Updates:

Asset prices come from different sources and are refreshed every 10 minutes.
Reliability and Scalability:

The system must handle live data updates and display accurate portfolios efficiently.
It should be designed to scale beyond 250 users.
Solution: High-Level Design
Below is the architecture for the platform, broken into key components.

1. Data Sources (Price Feeds):
Multiple external APIs provide the latest prices for stocks and mutual funds.
Price data refreshes every 10 minutes and flows into the system.
2. Price Fetcher Service:
A service that periodically fetches updated prices from external APIs.
Uses batch processing to gather prices efficiently.
Stores this data in a Price Cache (to reduce frequent external API calls).
3. Portfolio Service:
Maintains user portfolios with:
User accounts and associated assets.
Calculations of portfolio value based on the latest prices.
Updates user portfolios when new price data is available.
Stores user data in a Portfolio Database.
4. Real-Time Notification System:
Pushes updated portfolio values to users when prices change.
Uses a publish/subscribe model (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for scalability.
5. User Interface (UI):
A web or mobile application where users can view their portfolios.
The UI fetches live data via APIs exposed by the Portfolio Service.
6. API Gateway:
A single entry point for external applications (e.g., UI) to access user data.
Handles requests efficiently and securely.

Detailed Components
1. Data Sources
Use APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg) to fetch prices for stocks and mutual funds.
Ensure redundancy by integrating multiple providers for reliability.
2. Price Fetcher Service
A scheduled task runs every 10 minutes to fetch price data.
Use multi-threading to handle multiple APIs in parallel.
Store the latest prices in a cache database (e.g., Redis).
3. Portfolio Service
Responsible for maintaining the portfolio for each user.
Key functions:
Fetch latest asset prices from the Price Cache.
Calculate the portfolio value for each user.
Update portfolio changes in real time.
Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, assets, and portfolios.
4. Real-Time Notification System
Implement a publish/subscribe model (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ):
When prices are updated, the portfolio service publishes updates to a topic.
Subscribers (UI or notification service) receive the updates in real time.
Use WebSockets for pushing updates to the UI.
5. User Interface
Users interact with the system through:
Portfolio Page: Displays current portfolio, individual asset details, and real-time updates.
Historical Data: Charts for price/portfolio trends.
Fetches data via REST APIs provided by the Portfolio Service.
6. API Gateway
A gateway ensures secure and efficient access to backend services.
Handles:
Authentication: Verifies user identity.
Throttling: Limits request rates to prevent overload.
Routing: Directs requests to appropriate services.
Implementation Strategy
Technology Stack:

Backend: Python/Django, Java/Spring Boot.
Databases:
Portfolio DB: PostgreSQL.
Cache DB: Redis.
Message Queue: Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Frontend: React.js, Angular, or Vue.js.
APIs: REST or GraphQL.
Scalability:

Horizontal Scaling:
Add more instances for services like Price Fetcher and Portfolio Service.
Caching:
Use Redis to reduce database load for frequently accessed data (e.g., prices).
Reliability:

Use load balancers to distribute requests.
Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana to track system health.
Data Consistency:

Ensure eventual consistency between prices and portfolios using a message queue.
Security:

Encrypt sensitive user data.
Use OAuth2 for secure API access.
Key Features and Flow
Price Update:

Every 10 minutes, the Price Fetcher updates the Price Cache.
Portfolio Service recalculates affected portfolios.
User Portfolio View:

When a user logs in, the Portfolio API fetches real-time data.
If prices update, WebSockets notify the user interface of the changes.
Scalable Design:

Kafka or RabbitMQ ensures efficient handling of updates, even with a growing user base.
Time Complexity
Price Fetching: 
O(ùëÜ)
O(S), where 
ùëÜ
S is the number of stocks and mutual funds.
Portfolio Updates: 
ùëÇ(√óùê¥)
O(U√óA), where 
ùëà
U is the number of users and 
ùê¥
A is the average number of assets per user.
Real-Time Notifications: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëà
)
O(U), where 
ùëà
U is the number of active users.
Space Complexity
Depends on the size of the Price Cache and Portfolio Database.
Cache: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëÜ
)
O(S), for storing stock/mutual fund prices.
Portfolio DB: 
ùëÇ
(
ùëà
√ó
ùê¥
)
O(U√óA), for storing user assets.
This design ensures reliability, scalability, and efficient real-time updates for managing user portfolios.
